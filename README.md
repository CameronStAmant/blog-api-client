This project is the client frontend side of a blog. It was built with React and communicates with the node server via REST API. While similar to the admin frontend side, this side allows users to read posts and comments, and if they have signed up, add comments as well. Posts only display if they have been published by an admin. Demos, credentials, and repos for both frontends and the backend can be found below:
